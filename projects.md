###### Here are a few of my projects at the university.

##### Github projects:

1. **Regression and Classification:** In the first part of this project, I implemented linear regression from scratch for both univariate data and multivariate data. In the second part, I used six classification models (logistic regression, SVM, kNN, decision tree, random forest, and naive Bayesian) to analyze a data set. The [link](https://github.com/Atefeh-Mohammadi/regression-and-classification) to full report and code on Github.

2. **NLP on Digikala Comments:** I Implemented naive Bayesian classifier from scratch to predict whether a Persian comment on a digikala product has recommended the product or not. The [link](https://github.com/Atefeh-Mohammadi/digikala_comments_analysis) to full report and code on Github.

3. **Classification on Lung Images:** A project to train a neural network (using Keras) on a dataset of lung's CT scan imagees in order to classify whether it is COVID19, PNEUMONIA or a normal lung. The [link](https://github.com/Atefeh-Mohammadi/lungs_image_classification) to full code on Github.

4. **Statistical Analysis:** A project to apply statistical analysis on "advertising" dataset and predict whether a person will click on a certain advertisement or not.
