subtitle: Hello and welcome to my personal website!

I graduated with a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Alzahra University in September 2021 with a last two years' GPA of 3.72 out of 4.0. My broad fields of interest are data science, Python programming, and machine learning. I enjoy solving mathematical problems. In my leisure time, I go cycling or I listen to music. I am currently looking for a graduate program in Computer Science.
