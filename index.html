I graduated with a B.Sc. in computer engineering from Alzahra University in September 2021. My fields of interest are data science, Python programming, and machine learning. I enjoy solving mathematical problems. In my leisure time, I go cycling or I listen to music. I am currently looking for a graduate program in computer science to start in Fall 2023.
