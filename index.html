I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Alzahra University in September 2021, achieving a GPA of 3.72 out of 4.0 in my final two years. My areas of expertise and interest include data science, Python programming, and machine learning. I have a passion for solving mathematical problems and in my free time, I enjoy cycling or listening to music. I am currently seeking a graduate program in Computer Science to further develop my skills and knowledge.
